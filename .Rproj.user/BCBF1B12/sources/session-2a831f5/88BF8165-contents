# Food Consumption Analysis

## Introduction

The data for this analysis is sourced from [Tidy Tuesday's Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-02-18) and is an webscrape from [nu3](https://www.nu3.de/blogs/nutrition/food-carbon-footprint-index-2018). 'nu3' is a German nutrition company that sells fitness, food and health products including a vegan range. They have created a table which consolidates information from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) relating to consumption of selected foodstuffs as well as median global emissions of CO2 equivalent per KG eaten. The data was collated in 2018 and most of the data is from 2013. There are limitations to this data set as it doesn't take into account different countries emissions of CO2*e*, the nutritional benefits of the foodstuff and it uses a selection of foodstuffs without justifying their inclusion. 

The data from this webpage was scraped, tidied and exported into a csv file with 1430 rows of data, comprising of 130 countries and 11 food categories and has the following variables.

|Variable      |Class     |Description |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
|country       |character | Country Name |
|food_category |character | Food Category |
|consumption   |double    | Consumption (kg/person/year) |
|co2_emmission |double    | Co2 Emission (Kg CO2/person/year) |


## What variation is there is consumption of food categories?

The first question to ask from the data is what is the distribution of consumption of different food categories? Figure 1 allows us to see that there is a significant variation in consumption. For example we can see that Milk - inc cheese has the highest median consumption and the highest individual consumption and that Soybeans are the least consumed of the food categories. 
As well as the differences in median and maximum values there is a big range in consumption even among categories that have similar median values such as Pork and Eggs. 

With the worlds increasing knowledge of the need to reduce our collective carbon footprint does the carbon footprint of a food category impact its consumption or is it not impacted by carbon footprint?
## Does consumption affect carbon footprint

##  Do different food categories have different carbon footprints?


```{r, Animal Vs Plant dotplot, fig.cap="Base R plot of Carbon Footprint of 1KG of each food group"}

co2 <- dat %>% 
  group_by(food_category) %>% 
  mutate(co2_per_kg = co2_emmission/consumption) %>% 
  summarise(co2_per_kg = round(mean(co2_per_kg, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>% # Calculate co2 per kg eaten by country
  arrange(co2_per_kg) %>% 
  #Create factor levels dividing food groups into plant or animal origin
  mutate(food_category = as.factor(food_category),
        food_group = c(0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1),
        food_group = factor(food_group, labels = c('Plant Protein', 'Animal Protein')))
  
  my_cols <- cbbPalette[c(2,6)] # set colours from palate to be used in graph
  
  dotchart(co2$co2_per_kg, labels = co2$food_category, # create base R dotchart
           xlab = 'CO2 emissions per KG',
           
           color = my_cols[co2$food_group], # use colours from Palate 
           main =  'Carbon footprint per KG consumed',
           cex = 1.1,
           pch = 15,
           cex.main = 1.2)
  legend(20, 5, legend=c("Plant Protein", "Animal Protein"),
       col=my_cols, pch = 15, cex=1.1)


```

\


Figure 2 shows that there is significant variation in the carbon footprint of food types with Beef and Lamb having the highest emissions by KG consumed with everything else being significantly less. We can also see an overall pattern that generally plant based proteins have a lower carbon footprint than animal proteins.

## Does Consumption affect Carbon Footprint?

```{r scatter, fig.cap = "CO2 Emissions by country" }

         food_group = factor(food_group, labels = c('Plant', 'Animal'))) %>% 
  rename("NAME_LONG" = "country") %>% # change name of country so it matches other data frames
  group_by(NAME_LONG, food_group) %>%

Figure 3 explores whether a countries consumption of animal vs plant protein affects its overall carbon footprint. We can see that the largest bubbles appear to the right of the plot with high animal protein consumption. Although it is worth noting the pattern that with animal protein consumption increasing, plant protein generally increase too but the converse isn't true as there are many countries with a high level of plant protein consumption that don't have a high consumption of animal protein.

Another interesting point from this graph is that for the majority of countries the majority of their emissions come from animal products as the area of their point is mainly attributable to non-plant CO2 emissions. Combining the information we have learned from figure 1 and figure 2 we can suggest that this is the effect of high consumption of animal proteins as well as their generally higher carbon footprint. We can explore this relationship further in the interactive version of this graph clicking on each data point gives the country name and shows a breakdown of its consumption and CO2 emissions as seen in Figure 4. 

## What are different countries doing?


```{r bar chart, fig.cap = "Screenshot of interactive bar chart allowing user inputs of country, fixed axis and bar sorting criteria", out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/Bar Chart.png"))

```
 
\
Figure 4 shows a bar chart which can either be accessed by clicking on a point in Figure 3 or by selecting a country from a dropdown menu as shown in the figure. It includes a tick box option to fix the x axis at 0 - 1750KG in order to facilitate comparison between countries but removing this option allows for the finer details of countries with smaller consumption to be better visualised. Additionally we can sort the bars alphabetically (to allow for easy comparison) or by consumption or emissions. These user inputs are included in the plot title and subtitle.

## Is there a global pattern to emissions from food

```{r combined map, fig.cap= "Static map of CO2 emissions and wealth", results = "hide"}
co2 <- dat %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(co2_per_kg = co2_emmission/consumption) %>% 
  summarise(co2_per_kg = round(mean(co2_per_kg, na.rm = TRUE), 2),# Calculate co2 per kg eaten by country
            total_eaten = sum(consumption)) %>% # sum total kg eaten
  mutate(total_co2 = co2_per_kg * total_eaten) %>% # calculate total co2 by country
  select(country, total_co2)# reduce df to just country and co2 consumption
  
  ## Some names don't match between dataset and map information so need to chnaged to match
  
  correct_names <- co2 %>% 
    mutate(country = replace(country, country == 'Congo', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo'),
           country = replace(country, country == 'Gambia', 'The Gambia'),
           country = replace(country, country == 'Macedonia', 'North Macedonia'),
           country = replace(country, country == 'Russia', 'Russian Federation'),
           country = replace(country, country == 'South Korea', 'Republic of Korea'),
           country = replace(country, country == 'Swaziland', 'Kingdom of eSwatini'),
           country = replace(country, country == 'Swaziland', 'Kingdom of eSwatini'),
           country = replace(country, country == 'Taiwan. ROC', 'Taiwan'),
           country = replace(country, country == 'USA', 'United States'),) %>% 
    rename(NAME_LONG = country)
  
 # set options to correct any geometry issues and hide errors
  tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) 
  sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)
  # Create st object with projected corodinates
  
  world_projected  <- rnaturalearth::ne_download(returnclass = "sf") %>%
    select(NAME_LONG, ISO_A3_EH, POP_EST, GDP_MD, CONTINENT) %>%
    st_transform("+proj=moll")

  # Combine total co2 information with coordinates
  combined_df = left_join(world_projected,
                          correct_names)

combined_df <- combined_df %>%
  mutate(wealth = ntile((log(GDP_MD/POP_EST)), 100),
         total_co2 = ntile(total_co2,100))

tmap_mode("plot")

c<- tm_shape(combined_df) +
  tm_polygons(c("total_co2"),
              palette = 'viridis',
              title = c("Percentile of\nCO2 Emissions\nper person (Kg)")) +
  tm_layout(main.title = " Mapping of per capita CO2 Emissions and Wealth",
            frame = FALSE,
            )


w<-tm_shape(combined_df) +
  tm_polygons(c("wealth"),
              palette = 'viridis',
              title = c( 'Percentile of\nGDP per\ncapita'),
              n =5) +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE)

# sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)
tmap_arrange(c, w, nrow = 2, sync = TRUE)

```

\

In order to determine if there is a global pattern to CO2 emissions per person this information was plotted on a map (figure 5). This shows an interesting pattern whereby the lowest carbon footprint appears to be in Africa, Asia and Eastern South America with the highest emissions coming from Europe and North America. Beneath this map is included a measure of wealth of countries and this appears to follow a very similar pattern apart from Argentina which has a far higher level of emissions than other countries of a similar level of wealth.

So far we have seen that there is a huge variation in countries carbon footprint from these selected sources of protein. This effect is down to amount of consumption as well as what food types countries are eating. One current global trend is to convert to veganism which involves forgoing any animal protein. 

In order to explore if this is a potentially beneficial move, the global emissions from transferring every KG of animal protein consumed globally to a plant protein source was calculated and shown in Figure 6. This graphic shows that there is a massive potential to reduce the emissions from global food consumption. A complete removal of animal protein is probably not a sensible move but this graphic does provide a useful starting point in the discussion about reducing our meat consumption especially in the developed world.

# Graph Critique

## Bad Graph

Figure 7 shows how this  graph is originally presented as a part of a figure in the paper by Xie et al (2022). I have appraised graph (b) below but the way in which it is included in the paper surrounded by so much other information and relatively small makes interpretation difficult. 

```{r out.width ="50%", fig.cap="How the bad graph is orginally presented by Xie et al (2022)"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/Bad graph.jpg"))

```

\

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "The effect of different concentrations of LPS on bovine hepatocytes by measuring the relative expression of different inflammatory genes to a non-inflammatory gene (GAPDH) from Xie et al (2022)"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/Bad graph - 2.jpg"))
```

\

This visualisation is generally quite difficult to make any inferences from as it is very cluttered. The points outlined below make the message of the graph very difficult to interpret. As a standalone graph it lacks alot of key information, such as a title (annotation D), although an equivalent to this is included in the figure caption. Of more significance is the lack of a legend title (annotation F) as although we can infer that this is probably LPS concentration from the figure title it is possible that it could relate to something else. The legend (annotation F) also suffers from a poor choice of colour scale as although it is consistently used across x axis categories the colours are so similar it makes comparing the same concentration across categories very difficult. Either direct labeling of the points or a better choice of colour scale would have made this much better. The x axis is missing a title (annotation C) and so although we can tell there are different categories it isn't clear what these are categories of. The y axis of this graph (annotation A) although labeled, has two major flaws as it is split and so jumps from 2 to 80 and has vastly different scales for the higher numbers. This makes interpretation very difficult and is misleading as to the magnitude of differences between groups. Finally the labeling of P values (annotation B) adds alot of clutter to the graph and a more minimal way of labeling such as letters to show significance levels would improve this graphs readability.

## Good Graph

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.cap="The use of prelacteal feeds in Low and Middle income countries and is from a paper by Baker et al (2023)"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/Good graph.jpg"))
```

\


Figure 9 manages to convey the information required in a efficient manor although the purpose of the graph isn't clear as it is lacking a title but this information is included in the figure caption. The choice of a stacked bar is appropriate as it is showing the prevalence of categories that will add upto 100% The axis on this graph are very clear with the x axis (annotation E) having good sensible breaks and the y axis has good groupings of variables for comparison (annotation A) and the rotation of the graph allows of y axis categories (annotation B) to be easily read. The colour choice of the stacked bars (annotation C) allows for clear differentiation between categories. With the direct labeling (annotation D) of the sections of the bar allow for the exact size of each segment to be read without relying on the reader inference as this can be difficult to judge with a stacked bar chart. I especially like to attention to detail with the changing of colour of the text (annotation F) depending on the background to ensure the text remains clear as the consistent approach to decimalisation.
